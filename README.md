## Details

### Intoduction to IBM Watson Studio

We will be using IBM Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks to call both PAIRS and TWC APIs for this hackathon.  A great introduction to Watson Studio can be founnd here -> https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/python-pandas-workshop.  Go and follow all the step until you get to "Choose new notebook From URL".  Instead of using the .ipynb file shown, use this one <????> since it has calls to PAIRS and TWC APIs.
