# Climate Change event : 7-9th Feb 2020

## Get an IBMId and IBM Cloud login

Create your IBM ID account on http://ibm.biz/cloud-account. Your username is your Oxford University email address ending in ox.ac.uk and a password of your choice. You will need to verify your account through the email your receive in your Inbox.

Your IBM ID can be enabled to a large number of facilities - for now you will have had an IBM Cloud instance created for you and linked to your IBM ID

Once you have confirmed that an IBM ID has been created the next step is to just login.

Login to the https://cloud.ibm.com/login with your IBM ID you just created.

## Introductions

### Architecture

An overview of the architecture is shown below

### Introductions to Physical Analytics Integrated Data Repository and Services (PAIRS)

IBM PAIRS (Physical Analytics Integrated Data Repository and Services) GEOSCOPE is a platform, specifically designed for massive geospatial-temporal data (maps, satellite, weather, drone, IoT), query and analytics services. It frees up data scientists, developers from the cumbersome processes that dominate conventional data preparation and provides search-friendly access to a rich, diverse, and growing catalog of continually updated geospatial-temporal information.  See https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/marketplace/geospatial-big-data-analytics

There is both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to PAIRS as well as a PAIRS API.

### Introduction to The Weather Company (TWC)

### Introduction to Watson Studio

## Detailed steps for this Event

## Overview

You can use the PAIRS Graphical User Interface (GUI), PAIRS API calls and The Weather Company (TWC) API calls.  This section outliies how to access them.

## PAIRS

There are two modes for using PAIRS, Graphical User Interface (GUI) and via API calls.  When using the GUI version you are presented with Datalayers and DataSets.  This is a one to many relationship (a dataset contains many datalayers).  Datalayers that you have access are [here] (https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/PAIRS-datasets-datalayers-lists.xlsx)

### GUI
All you need to do is register your IBM ID against the PAIRS system - this is carried out as follows :
- Go to https://ibmpairs.mybluemix.net/
- Click "Get Started"
- Click "Sign in using IBMid"
- Enter your IBMid and then click Continue
- Login with your IBMid password
- Read the Terms and conditions and click "I accept the terms"
- You will be presented with the GUI of PAIRS
- Click the circular symbol to the top right of the screen and check your username is shown
- You are now part of the Trial group

- IMPORTANT : Notify the IBM team of your IBM ID (your email) since we have arranged for special access to some datasets that are not usually available.  They will add you to the Oxford Group.

There are a few short videos [here] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VD16H1q5IO3sP-i667TVyn4OsSP6kPc) that you can look at to understand how to use the GUI version of PAIRS.

### APIs
There are APIs to access a wide range of interface and are documented here ->  https://pairs.res.ibm.com/tutorial/documentation/api/core_api_v2.html and the Swagger link -> https://pairs.res.ibm.com/manual/api-doc/

In order to allow your IBM ID access to the PAIRS APIs you will need to register your IBM ID by going [here](http://ibm.biz/pairs-api-register).  Enter your IBM ID (email) and for the password enter 'pairs' (lowercase, without quotes).  You will see an ID on the screen, save this away somewhere but you will not need to use it to access the PAIRS APIs.

## TWC

### APIs
The full set of TWC APIs is shown [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ru_3wdMgpbM4aOCm-4qNAnRfjx2w-Ruw3lnr8Hnodk/edit).  To access them you will need an API key - this is supplied to you during the Event by the IBM team.

Some useful information on using TWC APIs is contained in this [PDF] (https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/TWC%20Data%20Package%20Summary.pdf).

## Calling PAIRS and TWC within Watson Studio

We will be using IBM Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks to call both PAIRS and TWC APIs for this event.
